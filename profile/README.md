# ✨ project voron

voron (or ворон in ukrainian) is a web platform for pentest, designed to maximize compliance and collaboration between pentesters.

It comes in the form of a dashboard, where pentesters can share notes, tasks and findings. This will then be bundled into a report
at the end of the pentest. It will (see roadmap) also come with a set of automation to automate passive recon.

We are a team of students, building this as our graduation project. If you wish to get in contact, feel free to contact us at
